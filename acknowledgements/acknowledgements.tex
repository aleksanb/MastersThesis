\noindent I would like to thank my advisor Professor Gunnar Tufte for sharing his knowledge with me,
and guiding my research through this weird and awesome part of Computer Science.

Further, I would like to thank Porter Robinson for creating the album "Worlds",
which provided the soundtrack for my final week of writing.
