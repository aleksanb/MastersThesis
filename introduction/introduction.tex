\chapter{Introduction}

Working title: "RBN as A Model for Matter Reservoirs".
In this masters thesis, the properties of RBN Reservoir Computing systems (RRCs) are investigated,
with the motivation of using the results as a template for instrumenting and performing computations on physical reservoir computing systems.

Having already created working RRCs for my pre-thesis project,
focus is now shifted towards what the optimal values of reservoir size, input connectivity, and output connectivity might be.
Finally we attempt to explain why some reservoirs perform better than others,
by looking at the backing Boolean Networks dynamical properties.

When using nontraditional physical devices for computation (Evolution in Materio) one is often limited in how one can perturb and read out the underlying substrate.
