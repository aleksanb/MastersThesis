\section{Analyzing reservoir dynamics}

\subsection{Description}

When analyzing Random Boolean Networks one often does so in aggregate,
looking at the population averages of the attributes of RBNs of a certain construction.
This as there can be large variance in individual RBN dynamics.
One often looks at whether the average network is chaotic, stable, or critical,
and the number of attractors, their size, their basins, and state-space transient times.
One can obtain expected values of the averages of these values if given a networks connectivity and size.

In my pre-thesis project (section \ref{section:pre-thesis-project}),
computational capability (section \ref{section:computational-capability}) is used as an indicator of reservoir performance.
Could there be a deeper link between the computational capability of an RBN used in a RRCs related to the RBNs dynamical properties?
What correlation is there between these dynamical properties (number of attractors, their lenght, transient times)
and how effective the RBN is as the basis of an RRC system?
If a relationship is found, does a change in task complexity constrain what values are required in aggregate?
Such findings can aid in the construction of RRCs by guiding the evolution of generative genomes used to create the backing RBN.

There are a number of ways to calculate a RBNs attractors and their properties.
They generally fall somewhere on the spectrum between exact enumeration (exhaustively searching for attractors from all initial states) and numerical sampling (searching from a subset only).
As the number of RBN states is exponential in the number of nodes ($ 2^{n\_nodes} $),
an exhaustive search can become computationally infeasible for larger networks.
Numerical sampling has the downside that it is biased for CRBNs with $ K != 2 $ \ref{berdahl2009random},
and we're using RBNs with $ K = 3$.

A simple implementation (listing \ref{lst:attractors}) of the exhaustive search algorithm allows for analysis of reservoirs with size $ n\_nodes <= 15 $.
We therefore use the computationally simple Temporal Density 3 and 5 tasks instead to investigate the attractor-accuracy relationship.
TD5 requires a size of at least 55 for 98\% accuracy \ref{tab:accuracy-thresholds}),
so results might require som interpretation.
Parameters for the experiment are shown in table \ref{tab:reservoir-dynamics-parameters}
