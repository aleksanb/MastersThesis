\section{Minimum required output connectivity}

\subsection{Description}

One isn't always able to fully instrument a computational substrate used for reserervoir computing.
While a microelectrode array gives coarse-grained access to smaller substrates than ever,
one is still limited to a number of samples equal to the number of microelectrodes in the array.
Other reasons can include instrumentation being prohibitively expensive,
physically impractical or impossible,
or quantum effects changing the material as one observes it.
These situations result in less internal state and potentially less computational power being exposed to the user.

How does this restricted viewing of the reservoir state affect its predictive behavior?
If there is an interference effect between the unobserved parts of the reservoir,
does this effect increase the computational ability of the observed subset or decrease it?
To test this hypothesis,
chosen subsets of larger reservoirs will be compared to separate reservoirs of that exact size.
This subset should perform better, equal, or worse than the independent reservoir, and therefore answer the hypothesis.

To reduce the search space, only Temporal Parity 3 and 5 will be used for these experiments.
In addition, all reservoirs will have a fixed input connectivity of 50\%,
backed by the findings of optimal IC from the previous section (as summarized in table \ref{tab:accuracy-thresholds}).
Reservoir subsets will be chosen randomly from all available nodes,
which only seems fitting given the random nature of the RBN and the lack of a meaningful physical projection.
The reservoir parameters used for this experiment are shown in table \ref{tab:oc-reservoir-parameters},
with the parameters for Temporal Parity staying the as for the previous experiments (table \ref{tab:tasks}).

\subsection{Results}

For easier comparison of the performance of a reservoir subset against reservoirs of that exact size,
plots aggregating the best accuracy distributions for each reservoir size are created.
These are based on the accuracy distribution for the optimal input connectivity for that reservoir size,
as shown in table \ref{tab:chosen-optimal-ic-values} in appendix \ref{app:reservoir_size-input_connectivity}.
These are then compared to the subset-accuracy plots created from the parameters of table \ref{tab:oc-reservoir-parameters}.

Figure \ref{fig:output-connectivity-TP3} shows this comparison for task TP3, up to a reservoir size of 100.
Figure \ref{fig:output-connectivity-TP5} shows the same comparison for task TP5, up to a reservoir size of 140.
The subset-accuracy plots for reservoir sizes $ \le 100 $ and $ \le 140 $ not presented here are shown in figures \ref{fig:TP3-OC-1} through \ref{fig:TP5-OC-2} in appendix \ref{app:minimum_output-connectivity}.

\subsection{Discussion}

An additional concern is in what way chosing a subset of regression variables and using them for regression affects the variance of the prediction result.
Intuition might suggest that a smaller set of regression variables would lead to a strictly worse prediction,
but this might not be the fact, as the field of \cite{} would show.

The resulting distributions from reservoir subsets and same-sized reservoirs are extremely similar.
This is seen in plots \ref{fig:output-connectivity-TP3} andd \ref{fig:output-connectivity-TP5},
and numerated in table \ref{tab:accuracy-similarity-table}.

\todo{Following sections need emprical backing, as visuals point to subsets having a slight advantage over same-sized reservoirs for small N.}

The fact that reservoir subsets perform roughly as well as same-sized subsets indicates that any interference from the unused parts of the reservoir may be minimal.
There seems to be a slight increase in population accuracy for small values of N (10, 20),
but a larger sample size would probably be needed to discern whether this is randomness or positive interference.
\todo{Maybe the above can be answered by more statistical tests?}

In a continiously growing and expaning reservoir system,
computational capability would probably grow monotonically in correlation with the increase in substrate.
These results show that as long as one has instrumented a large enough part of the resvoir in the first place,
one will not have to re-instrument it in the future as long as the task doesn't change to a more complex one.

One might have to recalibrate the readout layer however,
as a regression model trained on a certain graph might not work on a slightly modified one.
In my pre-project thesis \ref{MYPREPRPOJTHESIS},
it was found that there is a certain neutrality in the set of RRC systems.
That is, if one were to re-use a readout layer from a well-performing reservoir,
there will be a number of other reservoirs that can perform accurately with the same readout layer.
It was not investigated however whether these hotswappable reservoirs were structurally similar.
If they were, one might not have to retrain the model every time the substrate evolves.

Finally, there's a possibility that slightly better overall performance could have been achieved by generating reservoirs for all ICs instead of using a flat IC of 50\%.
Even though the average optimal IC is quite close to 50\%,
the backing data may lie slightly to either side,
as optimal IC table \ref{tab:oc-reservoir-parameters} shows.

The conclusion becomes that reservoir-subsets perform at least as well as their same-sized reservoir counterparts.
